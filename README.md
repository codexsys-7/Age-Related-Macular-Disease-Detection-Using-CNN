Age Related Macular Degeneration is a type of eye disease which normally affects the central vision of a person. This Disease might sometimes lead to permanent vision loss in some persons and mostly this might affect the people who are aged above 50. This disease doesnâ€™t lead to permanent vision loss but it will definitely impact the peripheral vision. So, basically there are 2 different types of ARMD i.e., Dry and Wet, Dry ARMD will generate a tiny amount of protein deposits called drusen, whereas Wet ARMD occurs whenever any abnormal blood vessel is developed under the retina, so sometimes this blood vessels might leak blood fluid, this type of ARMD is very severe and can even lead to severe permanent central vision loss.
